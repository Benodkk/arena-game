## Personal goal of this project

This is first "big" project where I used redux, thats why I wanted to use as many variables as possible.
Maybe react is not designed for making games, but this is browser game and as long as I want to develop my react skills this project seemed to be very good practice and it really was. Fight section would not look that good without animations and there I could practice making animations.
